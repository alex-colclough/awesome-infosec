# Awesome Information Security Resources

**A curated collection of free cybersecurity resources**

It is a lementable reality that we need cybersecurity and that it is so complex and expensive. We initially created this list to provide our clients a list of resources that can improve their security at a low or no cost.  The pretty version of this list is available at [infosecstack.com](https://www.infosecstack.com).

Please note that not every resource in this repository will be useful to every person or organization.  Some of the resources are incredibly detailed, and others are more fundamental. Additionally, some resources appear more than once in this list if they can be reasonably categorized in more than one area.
